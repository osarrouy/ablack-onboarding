# Aragon Black On-Boarding

## Technologies

Aragon Black mostly works with the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain, [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as a distributed storage layer, [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) as a distributed data structuration protocol and [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) as a solidity / dApp framework.

### Ethereum

Developing for Ethereum mostly embraces [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/) as an EVM progamming language, [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) as a library to interact with the blockchain from node-based / browser-based dApps and [truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) as a framework to ease the development of and the interaction with smart contracts. The best starting point to dive into the ecosystem is probably read the related docs and head towards [EthHub](https://docs.ethhub.io/) which centralizes lots of ressources.

### IPFS & IPLD

The web is full of IPFS & IPLD tutorials but Protocol Labs [the company behind IPFS and IPLD] has just published a couple of great tutorials [here](https://proto.school/#/)?

### dApps

There are also tons of tutorial about how to couple Ethereum and IPFS but [this one](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-gentle-intro-to-building-a-full-stack-dapp-on-ethereum-part-1-c1aedb11fcd2) could be a great starting point.

### Aragon

Aragon has a great dev portal with tons of documentation and tutorials [here](https://hack.aragon.org/).

## Communication

### Public chat

Aragon public chat relies on [Rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat/). Its server is located at [https://aragon.chat](https://aragon.chat).

### Internal chat

Aragon internal chat - including Aragon Black internal chat - relies on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/): a slack-replacement, a PKI, an encrypted git repository provider, etc.
